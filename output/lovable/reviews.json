    "text": "I have tried almost all AI-powered developer tools, and this one stands above the rest. It delivers code with very high precision and rarely breaks. It truly understands even the weakest prompts, and its seamless integration with Supabase is impressive. I am genuinely curious about what is running behind the scenes. The downside for me is not offering credit/token base, it only offers subscription. Keep up the excellent work!",
